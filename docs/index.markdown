# MICROSITE_TITLE

Welcome to the **The AI Alliance**: **MICROSITE_TITLE**. 

{: .tip }
> **TIP:** Use the search box at the top of this page to find specific content.

{: .attention }
> We are looking for collaborators. Please join us! See our [contributing]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing) page for details.

{: .note }
> **NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress website for the MICROSITE_TITLE.

{: .important }
> **IMPORTANT:** The "boilerplate" text on this page mixes content you might want to use, as well as tips on writing Markdown. See also the comments in the source files. Make sure you search for and change all TODOs on all the pages!

{: .warning }
> **WARNING!** This is a warning! Don't forgot to clean up the TODOs!

A _generic_ quote:

> Shakespeare once wrote, "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

This site is organized into the following sections [^1] (with an example footnote):

* [TODO - second top-level page]({{site.baseurl}}/second_page)
    * [alternative link](second_page)
* [TODO - nested]({{site.baseurl}}/nested/)

Note how relative links are written. For siblings (like the next set of bullets...) or subpages, you don't have to use the `{{site.baseurl}}` prefix (like the `alternative link`), but use `{{site.baseurl}}` instead of relative navigation hacks like `../../foo/bar`.

## Section Two

A Python code block:

```python
def flibulate_the_ganzinator(how_much):
  pass
```

## Additional links

Some additional links.[^2]

* [Contributing]({{site.baseurl}}/contributing): We welcome your contributions! Here's how you can contribute.
* [About Us]({{site.baseurl}}/about): More about the AI Alliance and this project.
* [Project GitHub Repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME){:target="repo"}
* [The AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai){:target="ai-alliance"}: The AI Alliance website.

Note our convention that external URLs include a target, specified with `{:target="some_name"}`. Adding these targets means browsers will automatically open external links in a new tab. You will also notice that external links get a little box and arrow adornment. This is done automatically through a clever CSS hack in `docs/_includes/css/custom.scss.liquid`.

A table example using standard Markdown and showing how to set the desired alignment. (The extra whitespace in the source is only for easier readability.):

| Column 1 (Left Aligned) | Column 2 (Centered) | Column 3 (Numbers - Right Aligned) |
| :------- | :------------------: | -----: |
| text 1   | centered             | 1      |
| text 2   | also centered        | 20     |
| text 3   | and this is centered | 300    |

[^1]: Use `[^N]` (for increasing `N` values) to mark "footnote #N" in text, as shown above. This is an example footnote with a link to it from above, and a link at the end of the footnote to go back to the point in the text (the "curled" arrow). **WARNING**, you must include the colon in the footnote definition as shown here, `[^1]:`.
[^2]: A second example footnote. Note that you don't need to put a blank line between them; they work like lists.

<!-- 
Use the following construct anywhere in the page to automatically
show a table of contents for the sections on the page. This is 
_different_ than a list of child pages (i.e., separate markdown files).
That list is always shown at the bottom automatically, as defined in
the default.html template file.
